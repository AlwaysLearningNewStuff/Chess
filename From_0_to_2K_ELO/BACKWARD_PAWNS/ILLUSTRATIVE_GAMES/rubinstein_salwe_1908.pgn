1.d4 {Notes by Lasker} d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c5 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nf3
Nf6 6.g3 Nc6 7.Bg2 {Already this mode of developing the Bishop
is determined by the weakness of Black on d5.} cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6
9.Nxc6 bxc6 10.O-O Be7 11.Na4 {White concentrates on c5 and
c6.} Qb5 12.Be3 O-O 13.Rc1 Bg4 {Black should rather
strenghthen c6 by Bd7.} 14.f3 Be6 15.Bc5 Rfe8 16.Rf2 Nd7
17.Bxe7 Rxe7 18.Qd4 Ree8 19.Bf1 Rec8 20.e3 Qb7 21.Nc5 Nxc5
22.Rxc5 {Now c5 is gained and the Pawn at c6 fixed; that Pawn
therefore becomes the target.} Rc7 23.Rfc2 Qb6 24.b4 {White
threatens b5. Black has no time for 24...Bd7. The sequence is
25.b5 Rac8 26.Qc3 and Black cannot liberate himself. Again if
24...Bd7 25.b5 Rcc8 26.bxc6 Bxc6 27.Qc3.} a6 25.Ra5 Rb8 26.a3
Ra7 {Black cannot guard all of his weak spots.} 27.Rxc6 Qxc6
28.Qxa7 Ra8 29.Qc5 Qb7 30.Kf2 {The intent is to guard his own
weaknesses, particularly on the second and third ranks.} h5
31.Be2 g6 32.Qd6 {The c-file is important because open.} Qc8
33.Rc5 Qb7 34.h4 a5 {A desperate attempt at a counter-attack.}
35.Rc7 Qb8 36.b5 a4 37.b6 Ra5 38.b7 {This game illustrates how
much greater weight the effect of the pieces on weaknesses has
in comparison to their effect on other points.} 1-0
