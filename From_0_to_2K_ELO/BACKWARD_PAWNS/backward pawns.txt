 =========== CONS:

 - backward pawns cannot be defended by other pawns so our pieces must defend them which passivizes them
 - endgames, especially pawn ones, are usually lost for the side with backward pawn
 - backward pawns usually obstruct our piece coordination
 - square in front of the backward pawn is usually weak
 - succeptible to blockade, which might paralize it's entire army

============ PROS:

 - none :(

============ SIDE WITH THE BACKWARD PAWN:

- get rid of the backward pawn, possible solutions include:
           - sacrifice it for superior piece activity if possible
           - move it forward, forcing its exchange or creating hanging pawns which are better option
- control the square in front of the backward pawn with the pawn if possible, otherwise with pieces
- dynamically exchange the backward pawn for opponent's pawn (usually involves tactical tricks)

============ SIDE WITH THE BACKWARD PAWN:

 - exhange the pieces guarding the square in front of the backward pawn
 - remove pawn protection of the square in front of the backward pawn
 - blockade the backward pawn with a piece
