============== SIDE WITH DOUBLED PAWNS:

do not move doubled pawns, leave them intact in phalanx state
doubled pawns prefer to be a part of pawn structure, they are very weak when isolated
doubled pawns offer additional control of the squares, but less pawn breaks
piece play is prevalent

============== SIDE FIGHTING DOUBLED PAWNS:

force pawns to move and occupy newly created weak squares with pieces
pawn endgame is usually won since doubled pawns can not produce passed pawn
any type of endgame usually gives advantage to side without doubled pawns
consider exchanging front doubled pawn to open lines for attack on the remaining one
