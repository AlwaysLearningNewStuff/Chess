GUIDELINES: 

 - Control central space with your pawns
 - Castle early to connect the rooks and evacuate king from the center of the board
 - Develop every piece, do not move same piece twice
 - Do not introduce queen into battlefield early on -> opponents minor pieces develop with "tempo"
 - Strike when you have advantage
	If you succeed in getting a large lead in development 
	(especially if you have castled and your opponent isn't), 
	there might be a chance for you to win the game by 
	opening the center and starting a tactical skirmish with your fully mobilized army, 
	before your opponent's pieces come into play
 - Develop your pieces in following order: knights first, then bishops, castle
 - Do not move the pawns in front of the king
 - capture/develop towards the center
 - Attack on the wing is refuted with the action in the center of the board
 - Do not chase a piece that you want to exchange, 
	put your own piece you want to exchange on strong squares 
	so opponent is forced to exchange it
 
TYPICAL MISTAKES:
 
 - lagging in development
 - late castling
 - passive/unnecessary moves, weak threats/attacks
 - playing with one piece excessively
 - pawn grabbing
 - randomly checking the opponent's king
 - bad exchanges
