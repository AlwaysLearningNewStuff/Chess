 - Each pawn move lessens a control of a square but also figths to control new square
 - Uncontrolled square is a square that can no longer be controlled with a pawn
 - With such a square we can no longer drive away opponent's piece if it lands there
 - Weak squares are squares we do not control with our pawns that can become great outposts for opponent's pieces
 - Strong squares are squares uncontrolled  by opponent that can become great outposts for our pieces

====== PLANS FOR SIDE WITH WEAK SQUARE:

 - Keep your pieces that can control that square on the board
 - exchange opponent's pieces that can land on weak square for your pieces that can not control weak square

====== PLANS FOR EXPLOITING WEAK SQUARE:

 - exchange opponent's pieces that can control weak square for your pieces that can not control weak square
 - control weak square with a pawn and then use that square as an outpost for your pieces
