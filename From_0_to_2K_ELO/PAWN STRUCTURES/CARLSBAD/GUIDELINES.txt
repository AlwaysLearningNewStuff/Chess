White is in the driver's seat.
Black's reaction depends on which plan White adopts.

=========== PLANS FOR WHITE :

 - minority attack with b4-b5xc6
        
   1. White carries out the b4-b5 advance when Black can not reply with ...c6-c5, 
      which means that White needs to control the c-file and in particular the c5-square.

   2. It is useful for White to exchange his own dark-squared bishop for the enemy knight.

   3. The move g2-g3 is also good for White, protecting against the possible advance of the enemy f-pawn.

   4. White often exchanges light-squared bishops to make progress with the minority attack.

   5. keep rooks on the board, remove minor pieces

 - attack in the centre with e3-e4
 - kingside attack with both sides castled on the kingside
 - kingside attack with the kings castled on opposite sides
 - play in positions with both sides castled on the queenside

=========== PLANS FOR BLACK :

 - kingside counterattack with pawns
 - Kingside counterattack with pieces
 - positional methods of defense (b5 barrier + c4 outpost, a6/a5 push, cxb5 + a5)
 - c5 break, creating isolated d5 pawn
 - counter-attack against White's queenside castle
