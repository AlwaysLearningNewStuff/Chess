========== CHARACTERISTICS:

 - has no neighbouring pawns, which makes it a static weakness, especially in the endgame
 - square in front of the isolated pawn is great outpost for opponent's pieces 
 - usually offers space advantage, great outposts and active piece play to the owner

========== SIDE WITH THE ISOLATED PAWN:

 - strives to advance the pawn, opening the game while opponent is discoordinated
 - strives to attack, usually launching mating attack on the kingside
 - refrains from moving the pawns so it can use 3rd/6th rank to position the rooks for attack

========== SIDE FIGHTING THE ISOLATED PAWN:

 - strives for exchanges, especially pawn endgames
 - strives to blockade the isolated pawn and then siege it ( use the square in front of the isolated pawn)
 - strives for pure heavy piece (rooks/queens) endgames using "Alekhine gun" to capture the isolated pawn
 - transposition, via exchange, into isolated pawn pair with backward pawn
