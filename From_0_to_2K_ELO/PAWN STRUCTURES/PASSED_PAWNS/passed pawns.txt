=============== PROS:

 - on its march it creates great outposts for its army
 - has no pawn opposition to stop it from promotion
 - usually offers space advantage
 - ties enemy pieces to passive positions in order to stop it from advancing

=============== CONS:

 - can become overextended becoming to expensive to protect
 - can be sieged on its open file
 - endgames are very unclear and piece-position dependent

=============== SIDE WITH THE PASSED PAWN:

prefers to keep rooks and queen on the board and exchange bishops and knights
prefers to have open files near the passed pawn
seeks favorable moment to transition into won endgame (endgame knowledge is essential, especially rook endgames)
tries to create another point of attack, usually the opponent's king

=============== SIDE FIGHTING THE PASSED PAWN:

prefers to exchange rooks and queen, while keeping bishops and knights on the board
must blockade the passed pawn and then siege it
tries to exploit overextension of the passed pawn (pawn endgames are ideal for this)
tries to open files around passed pawn and use them to siege the pawn from the flank
