======== PRELUDE: PIECE FEATURES

 - king -> can 1 vs 1 any piece in melee fight, slow, excellent blockader
 - pawn -> slow, immobile most of the time, promotion feature can win the game, excellent blockader
 - knight -> slow, clumsy movement pattern, can not create zugzwang, good blockader
 - bishop -> controls only half of the board, poor blockader, pawn structure dependent, long ranged
 - rook -> long ranged, fast and agile, poor blockader
 - queen -> Godlike mobility and firepower, long ranged, poor blockader, usually wins the game

======== GENERAL ENDGAME PLAN:

mindset change -> slow down, count to 10, then start thinking

evaluate both static and dynamic factors for both sides
	weak squares
	pawn structure
	piece coordination/mobility
	material balance

form a long-term plan -> lines are of secondary priority
	execution most of the time starts with king centralisation
	improve piece coordination
	fix pawn structure defects

paralize opponent 
	obtain initiative
	creation of the passed pawn
	rook on the 7th/2nd rank
	better piece coordination
	restrict opponent's piece mobility
	2 distant fronts give victory to the stronger side

win with zugzwang

======== SPECIAL DEFENSES FOR THE LOSING SIDE:

 - stalemate -> king is not in check and we have no legal moves
 - fortress -> stronger side can not penetrate into our position
 - pawns on one side of the board -> almost always ends in a draw
 - removal of all pawns -> pieces alone can not win most of the time
